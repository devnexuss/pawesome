				<h2>Let us learn more about dogs</h2>
				<h3>a. Do dogs know their name?</h3>
				<p>
					In my opinion, dogs are indeed aware of their names. I have two pet dogs named “KC” and “Phoebe and when we call them, they know who we're talking to. 
					It is fascinating to see how well dogs understand our words.
				</p>
				<p>
					A study says that dogs learn through connections. If a word is linked to something they enjoy, they connect the two. For instance, saying "walk" gets them excited.
					When we use their nicknames with affection, they connect those names to happy feelings, without us realizing it.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>b. Essential tips to raise healthy pets</h3>
				<p>
					Having pets is a wonderful experience for me. I treat them like family, not just as animals. So, their well-being is a top priority, aiming for a healthy, long, and happy life. 
					Keeping them healthy involves visiting a vet at least once a year. This helps in knowing their overall health and detecting any problems early. 
					Moreover, vaccinations are equally important, to protect them from harmful diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important tip to mention is the significance of maintaining a healthy weight, which can help prevent health issues. Similar to humans, obesity can lead to health problems for pets. 
					Alongside maintaining a healthy weight, providing them with a balanced and nutritious diet is essential.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, regular exercise plays a key role in keeping them healthy, benefiting both their physical and mental well-being. Lastly, ensuring cleanliness through regular grooming is equally important. 
					Together, these practices form a holistic approach to guarantee the overall health and happiness of our beloved pets.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>c. Why does my dog attack me?</h3>
				<p>
					According to research, potential reasons for a dog displaying aggression include fear, anxiety, uncertainty about expectations and actions, and the anticipation of potential punishment.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>d. How to throw a birthday party for your dog</h3>
				<p>
					Having these pets feels like a blessing from above, and celebrating their birthdays can be a joyful way to make them feel special.
				</p>
				<p>
					Preparing for dog birthday parties might involve incorporating their favorite treats, preferred foods, inviting their furry friends, and organizing some canine-friendly birthday games.
					Consider making it even more enjoyable with a dog-themed birthday party that includes their fur-parents in the celebration.
